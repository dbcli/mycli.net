has unique features like autocompletion and syntax highlighting that make it
easy to use.

Mycli is written in python using the wonderful [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit) library. It is
cross-platform compatible and it is tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

It is developed by a team of core devs from around the world. The
user-friendliness is not just limited to the tool but the entire community is
friendly and welcoming to newcomers. 

The project is lead by [Thomas Roten](https://github.com/tsroten). The core
team constitutes [Irina](https://github.com/j-bennet),
[Dick](https://github.com/meeuw), [François](https://github.com/fpietka),
